The w3develops source codebase. Learn to code. Meet new people.


What is W3Develops?

The goal of W3Develops is to provide a simple learning, collaborating, networking website for programmers.

It is not "industrial quality", with an emphasis on allowing the novice user to be able to contribute to the code.

It is a work in progress and is not feature complete at this point, however it is usable as an educational tool.

W3Develops has the following constraint: 

This initial version was put together in a couple of weeks as a solo Chingu Collabs, #100DaysofCode, freeCodeCamp project. 

Repo Overview

    LICENSE -- MIT License
    README.md -- This File
   index.html -- The landing page source code 

TODO

    Make our own collab challenges
    Fix bugs in the code
    Refactor the group chat to be simpler
    Start live code collabs via atom code editor
    Come up with some labs for adding certain features.
    More todos ;)

Pull requests welcome! Please keep in mind simplicity & teaching over correctness.




Tasks:

For the job and internships section, i want to be able to simulteaneusly search all the job sites listed in out group files. and have filters for the newest jobs, freelance jobs, filter which sites to search(if you want to search 1,2,3,or more).

i want to have our own messanger thats email like protonmail and facebook messanger mixed.

i want a question and answer forum like quora, stack exchange, and freecodecamps forum.

i want users to be able to customize the site and add their own features others can opt in to, kinda like firefox plugins.

i want the search bar to just be a magnify glass to the left of the login/sign up button on the navigation bar. i want it to be like the one on developer.mozilla.org, where you click it and then it expands.

i want the search bar to be able to search mozilla.developer.org and google.com and w3develops. with check boxes above the search bar that allow us to search results from just one or from all of those sites in one search.

courses and roadmaps will be a curated list of courses we have personally tried and succeeded using. roadmaps are lists of path beginners should follow to reach their path to becoming a professional.

web technologies will be a link to mozilla developer.org's list of web technologies

we will have a meetup section, for scheduled online meetups and were people can host meetups for their state or territory in theri country.

our team will be the names and pictures of everybody who helped build and maintain the site

references and guides will be like technologies and roadmaps, except instead of just web technologies references it will be all major programming languages and such. Also the guides will be more about how to use the stuff unlike roadmaps which is just about which path to follow

sitemap should be the entire site laid out in laymens terms so people can see how to use it, what its about and where to go if theyre looking for something

i want to make the login page popout like the one on quora.com and also allow people to login via github

tutorials will be websites like freecodecamp.org , cs50, a nano degree you've taken and can vouche for, and so on.

Practice will be practice projects like the ones offered at chingu where there are 3 tiers of web developer(beginner, intermediate, advanced) and the practice projects will reflect their skill level. This is in essence a variation of a build to learn project where users are learning through hands on building(practice), team collaboration, and resources like freecodecamp at the same time.

projects will be projects will be categorized by programming languages and skill level and will be up to the members of our site to create and host on our site for other people to see and collaborate or ask to collaborate on.
